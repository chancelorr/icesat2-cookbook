    "# Governance for the NASA ICESat‑2 Mission Cookbook\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Purpose\n",
    "This cookbook provides an open, community driven, and sustainable space to consolidate workflows, tools, and tutorials related to NASA's ICESat-2 mission. It draws from successful governance structures used in [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org) and promotes openness, reproducibility, and accessibility.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The NASA ICESat-2 Cookbook aims to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide **foundational tutorials** and **example workflows** for ICESat-2 data products\n",
    "- Improve accessibility of training materials\n",
    "- Ensure high-quality, reproducible examples that can be run via Binder or cloud platforms\n",
    "- Foster collaboration between mission scientists, tool developers, educators, and learners\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Governance Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steering Committee\n",
    "\n",
    "The Steering Committee oversees the vision, content quality, and community processes. Suggested roles include:\n",
